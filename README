Description:

Shows duplicate recordings.

Detection method:

The detection method is based on recording information. 

Recordings without a description or a short description are not 
included in the comparison and are shown at the botton of the 
duplicate recordings list.

Recordings are not considered duplicate if title comparison is 
active and shorter title in not included in the other title. 

The short description and the description are concatenated to a
string. Spaces and '|' characters are removed from the string.
Recordings are considered duplicate if the shorter string is
included in the other string.
